    "\n",
    "- Using small modules can help organize larger applications.\n",
    "- Bundling useful logic into modules helps programmers share code with one another more easily.\n",
    "- Using someone else's pre-written code can save you the trouble of having to write tedious code yourself.\n",
    "- Python comes with countless modules that programmers can use.\n",

    "- Opening a file\n",
    "- Reading the contents of that file into a string\n",
    "- Splitting the string on the newline character\n",
    "- Splitting each line on the comma character\n",
    "\n",
    "We can work with CSV files more easily through the csv module. This module has a reader() function that takes a file object as its argument, and returns an object that represents our data. We'll cover objects in more depth in the next mission, but for now, we'll simply convert this object to a list and use that result."
