An intuitive way to do this would be to match any string that contains four consecutive integers.

For example, \"[0-9]\" will match any character that falls between 0 and 9 (all of which will be one-digit integers). Similarly, \"[a-z]\" would match any lowercase letter. We can also specify smaller ranges like \"[3-5]\" or \"[d-g]\".\n",
